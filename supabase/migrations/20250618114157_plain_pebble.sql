  # Fix RLS policy for book soft delete

  1. Policy Updates
    - Update the existing UPDATE policies for the `books` table to allow setting `is_active` to `false`
    - This enables soft delete functionality by allowing the `is_active` column to be updated to `false`

  2. Changes Made
    - Remove restrictive WITH CHECK conditions that prevent soft deletes
    - Allow authenticated and anonymous users to perform soft deletes (set is_active = false)
    - Maintain security while enabling the delete functionality

  3. Security
    - Keep existing USING conditions for row access control
    - Allow updates that set is_active to false for soft delete operations
