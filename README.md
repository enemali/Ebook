  image: "https://your-image-url.jpg",
  background: "https://your-background-url.jpg",
  quiz: {
    multipleChoice: {
      question: "Your question?",
      options: [
        { text: "Correct answer", isCorrect: true },
        { text: "Wrong answer", isCorrect: false }
      ]
    },
    spelling: {
      word: "challenge",
      hint: "This word means something difficult"
    }
  }
}
```

### Customizing AI Behavior
Modify the context strings in components to change how the AI assistant behaves:

- `getReadingAIContext()` in BookContent.tsx
- `getAIContext()` in QuizModal.tsx
- `getSettingsAIContext()` in SettingsModal.tsx

### Styling Customization
- Edit `tailwind.config.js` for color schemes and design tokens
