VITE_ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=your-actual-agent-id-here
VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
VITE_ELEVENLABS_USE_SIGNED_URL=false
VITE_ELEVENLABS_SIGNED_URL_ENDPOINT=/api/signed-url

# Google Gemini API Configuration (Optional)

## Customization

### Adding New Story Content
Edit `src/data/storyData.ts` to add new pages:

```typescript
{
  text: "Your story text here...",
  image: "https://your-image-url.jpg",
  background: "https://your-background-url.jpg",
  quiz: {
    multipleChoice: {
      question: "Your question?",
      options: [
        { text: "Correct answer", isCorrect: true },
        { text: "Wrong answer", isCorrect: false }
      ]
    },
    spelling: {
      word: "challenge",
      hint: "This word means something difficult"
    }
  }
}
```

### Customizing AI Behavior
The AI assistant behavior is controlled through context strings in components:

- `getReadingAIContext()` in BookContent.tsx
- `getAIContext()` in QuizModal.tsx
- `getSettingsAIContext()` in SettingsModal.tsx

### Environment Configuration
All sensitive settings are now managed through environment variables:

- **Development**: Use `.env.local` for local development
- **Production**: Set environment variables in your hosting platform
- **Security**: Never commit actual API keys to version control

### Styling Customization
- Edit `tailwind.config.js` for color schemes and design tokens
- Modify `src/index.css` for custom animations
- Update component classes for layout changes

## Browser Compatibility

- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+, Edge 80+
- **Features Required**: 
  - Web Speech API (for text-to-speech)
  - MediaDevices API (for camera access)
  - WebSocket support (for AI conversations)

## Performance Considerations

- Images are loaded from external URLs (Pexels)
- Text-to-speech uses browser's built-in voices
- AI conversations require internet connection
- OCR processing happens locally in the browser
